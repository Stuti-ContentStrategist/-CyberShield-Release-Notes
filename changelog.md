# 📜 Changelog

## 🧱 Overview

The **CyberShield Changelog** provides a detailed, chronological record of all product versions — documenting fixes, improvements, and feature additions.

It serves as a technical log for developers, QA teams, and product managers to track incremental evolution over time.

> 💡 **Tip:** A changelog is factual, not promotional — it should record _what changed_, _when_, and _why it matters._

#### 💡 Best Practice Guidelines

✅ Keep changelog entries concise and in past tense.\
✅ Log only meaningful user-impacting changes — avoid internal dev notes.\
✅ Use one consistent emoji/icon system across all entries.\
✅ Update changelog _before_ publishing release notes.\
✅ Maintain backward links to full version pages (v4.3.0 → “View Details”).

🧠 **Info:** A changelog isn’t just history — it’s proof of evolution, transparency, and technical maturity.
